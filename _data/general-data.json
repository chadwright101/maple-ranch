Staff exceptionally warm and friendly. Atmospheric vibe was also very homey, warm and relaxing. Spacious and not overcrowded. Don't have kiddies but the play area looked very enticing almost took my shoes off to join."

        "review": "Fantastic, kid friendly, spacious place. Our new favourite stop on the N2. The highlight is obviously the huge, unique play area and the fact that there is both indoor and outdoor space for kids to play. You can see the facilities were designed by someone who knows kids. Plus, decent pizza, lovely milkshakes (try cookies and cream flavour!) and service that felt genuinely warm and friendly. Farm stall with plenty of handmade and homemade stuff, including cute Afrikaans stuff. Groups without kids can sit on the other side of the stoep and enjoy the view of the forest, river and pond. Looks like you could also take a little walk. So refreshing compared to most roadside stops."
