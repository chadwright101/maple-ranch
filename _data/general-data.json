The highlight is obviously the huge, unique play area and the fact that there is both indoor and outdoor space for kids to play. You can see the facilities were designed by someone who knows kids. Plus, decent pizza, lovely milkshakes (try cookies and cream flavour!) and service that felt genuinely warm and friendly. Farm stall with plenty of handmade and homemade stuff, including cute Afrikaans stuff. Groups without kids can sit on the other side of the stoep and enjoy the view of the forest, river and pond. Looks like you could also take a little walk. So refreshing compared to most roadside stops."

These horses, originally and still bred for and by the American cowboy, were selected and evolved for the athleticism, intelligence and temperament required to work cattle and compete in numerous Equine sports requiring bursts of speed, sharp stops and turns, a calm and kind disposition with a compliant mind, to make life safer and pleasurable for the rider.",
        "Their compact, muscular bodies, small and broad heads are generally how one recognizes them.",
        "We lease grazing roughly 5km from Maple Ranch, where most of the general herd graze entirely on good, green veld grasses year round. Our young stud sire, Bold Enterprise, and a few mares can be seen at Maple Ranch during the breeding spring season and you can visit the new foals from August through till the summer months. We have six beautiful, registered QH mares carrying our new sire's foals this year. So we are very excited to see their colors and get to know their personalities whilst we watch them gallop and play."
